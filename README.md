# üå≤ Root: Our Digital Adaptation
Welcome to our recreation of the beloved Root tabletop game reimagined as a digital experience! \
This project is being developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming 3 (COSC 2200) course at Durham College. Our goal is to apply advanced OOP principles to build a structured, scalable, and interactive game using C# and WPF.

# üéÆ About the Game
Deep in a vast and mysterious forest, four factions are locked in a struggle for power. The once-mighty Eyrie Dynasties seek to reclaim their lost glory. The ambitious Marquise de Cat has industrialized the woods for her own ends. Meanwhile, the Woodland Alliance stirs in the shadows, plotting a rebellion, and a lone Vagabond roams the land, picking sides (or playing all of them).

Root is a wildly asymmetric strategy game where every faction has its own goals, mechanics, and playstyle. No two players experience the game the same way.

Whether you're a seasoned Root player or discovering it for the first time, this game brings the woodland to life, one turn at a time.
